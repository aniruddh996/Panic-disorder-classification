In the realm of mental health, accurately identifying panic disorder plays a vital role in providing timely support and intervention. In this project, I tackled the task of binary classification, aiming to detect panic disorder based on given data.

To kickstart the project, I obtained a dataset from Kaggle and embarked on a journey of exploration and analysis. However, I encountered an obstacle along the way - the data was imbalanced. Undeterred, I leveraged multiple algorithms and implemented balanced class weights to ensure fair evaluation of their performance.

I meticulously assessed various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms. After thorough experimentation, I found that the Random Forest Classifier yielded promising results, emerging as a strong contender for detecting panic disorder within the dataset.

To further enhance the accuracy and usability of the classification model, I devised a survey consisting of 17 carefully crafted questions. By leveraging user inputs, the model generates predictions to determine the presence or absence of panic disorder in an individual.

By sharing this project, I aim to contribute to the broader understanding and detection of panic disorder. Together, we can work towards improving mental health assessment methodologies and facilitating early interventions for individuals in need.
